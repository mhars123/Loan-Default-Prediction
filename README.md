# Loan-Default-Prediction
Build a classification model to predict clients who are likely to default on their loan and give recommendations to the bank on the important features to consider while approving a loan.
# Problem Definition and Objective

• A bank's consumer credit department aims to simplify the decision-making process for home equity lines of
credit to be accepted.

• To do this, they will adopt the Equal Credit Opportunity Act guidelines to establish an empirically derived
and statistically sound model for credit scoring.

• The model will be based on the data obtained via the existing loan underwriting process from recent
applicants who have been given credit.

• The model will be built from predictive modeling techniques, but the model created must be interpretable
enough to provide a justification for any adverse behavior (rejections).
